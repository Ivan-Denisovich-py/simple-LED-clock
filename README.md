# simple-LED-clock
This is a traditional digital clock made with APDE using Java. It was inspired of a Daniel Shiffman video on Seven Segment Display in his exotic and fulfilling YouTube channel The Coding Train, where he suggests to the viewers to make a digital clock implementing his seven segment display program. So, this is my absolutely beginner-friendly first try on APDE. An important note is, it does not use any of the object oriented principles of programming. It may have been the best to have used those but I am not yet familiar with those as much I would have wanted to be and also, I wanted the code to remain short.

# APDE
Android Processing Development Environment is the most powerful IDE on Android I have set my eyes on till now. It creates apps and live wallpapers out of sketches with just a few clicks which was miraculous to me. My heartfelt thanks to the creators and developers of APDE.
