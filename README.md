# simple-LED-clock
This is a traditional digital clock made with APDE using Java. It was inspired of a Daniel Shiffman video on Seven Segment Display in his exotic and fulfilling YouTube channel The Coding Train, where he suggests to the viewers to make a digital clock implementing his seven segment display program. So, this is my absolutely beginner-friendly first try on APDE.
