# simple-LED-clock
This is a traditional digital clock made with APDE using Java. It was inspired of a Daniel Shiffman video on Seven Segment Display in his exotic and fulfilling YouTube channel The Coding Train, where he suggests to the viewers to make a digital clock implementing his seven segment display program. So, this is my absolutely beginner-friendly first try on APDE.
#APDE
Android Processing Development Environment is the most powerful IDE on Android I have set my eyes on. It creates apps and live wallpapers out of sketches with just a few clicks which was miraculous to me. My heartfelt thanks to the creates and developers of APDE.
